This is a simple Weather Search App utilizing Darksky.net's API. Once opening the AWS link below, you will see a search template where one can specify location to search the weather condition.

## AWS Link to the web page

## Technology Used
* Angular8
* Node.js/Express.js
* Typescript
* HTML
* CSS
* Darksky.net weather API
* ip-api for local geolocation

## Things to watch out for
* If your browser has adblock extensions enabled, the search will NOT work since submit button requires ip-api to return valid JSON and adblock extensions block this api call
* Some images may be missing because they have been deprecated
