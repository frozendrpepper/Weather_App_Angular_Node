This is a simple Weather Search App utilizing Darksky.net's API. Once opening the AWS link below, you will see a search template where one can specify location to search the weather condition.

## AWS Link to the web page
Due to the billing on AWS, I've taken down the Elastic Beanstalk EC2 instance. Here's a video demonstrating what the app looks like

## Directory Explanation
1) app/index = contains default app and index HTML and CSS files generated by Angular CLI
2) components = contains Typescript, HTML and CSS files for each component defined
3) services = contains Typescript files for each service passing information to components
4) backend = Node.js (Express.js) backend file

## Technology Used
* Angular8
* Node.js/Express.js
* Typescript
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* HTML
* CSS
* Darksky.net weather API
* ip-api for local geolocation

## Things to watch out for
* If your browser has adblock extensions enabled, the searching via current location will NOT work since adblock extensions block the ip-api call to get Client's geolocation
* Some images may be missing because they have been deprecated

### Project Origin
This project was carried out as part of CSCI 571 Web Technologies class at USC
